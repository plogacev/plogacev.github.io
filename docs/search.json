That means building models that make pricing decisions — not dashboards that sit unused.\nWhether you’re a retailer, a B2B supplier, or a direct-to-consumer brand, I work with you (or your agency) to identify pricing opportunities, model demand, and implement pricing logic that scales.\nI don’t just hand you elasticities — I deliver working solutions.\nGet in touch if you’d like to work together."

Technically fluent.\nI build models that are:\n\nCustom-fit to your context, not off-the-shelf\nDesigned for messy, real-world data\nDelivered as ready-to-use pricing logic, files, or API endpoints\n\nMy goal is always the same: help you charge the right price — confidently, repeatedly, and at scale.\nI’m based in Berlin and work with clients across Europe and North America.\nI speak English, German, and Russian."

    "text": "Common pricing challenges\n\n“We don’t have enough data”\nYou often have more useful data than you think. Transaction histories, competitor prices, customer segments, and even failed quotes contain pricing signals. Bayesian methods can extract insights from limited data by incorporating business knowledge.\n\n\n“Our market is too complex”\nComplex markets often mean more pricing opportunity, not less. When you sell thousands of SKUs across different regions, customer segments, or channels, there’s usually significant variation in willingness-to-pay that uniform pricing leaves on the table.\n\n\n“We tried dynamic pricing and it didn’t work”\nMost failed pricing initiatives suffer from poor implementation, not bad math. Prices that don’t account for inventory, competition, or customer perception will underperform regardless of the underlying model."
