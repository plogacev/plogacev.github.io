::: {#hero-heading}

I'm a freelance data scientist specializing in statistical modeling for business decisions — particularly in settings where data is messy, experimentation is limited, and off-the-shelf solutions fall short.

My work spans demand modeling, price elasticity estimation, forecasting, and causal inference. I build custom models using Bayesian methods, designed around the structure of your specific problem.

I've worked across B2C and B2B contexts, collaborating closely with stakeholders to understand how business processes actually work — so models reflect what matters and make the most of available data.
