::: {#hero-heading}

I help companies make better decisions through statistical modeling — especially when data is limited, messy, or poorly understood.

**How I work**

- I take time to understand your business context before modeling
- I build interpretable models, not black boxes
- I deliver working solutions — not just reports
- I communicate clearly with technical and non-technical stakeholders


[Get in touch](/contact.qmd) if you'd like to work together.

## What I Do

- Price elasticity estimation and price optimization
- Bayesian methods for sparse data
- Demand modeling and forecasting
- Causal inference (A/B tests, observational studies)
- Custom models tailored to your domain and problem

## Background

PhD in Cognitive Science (University of Potsdam). Before freelancing, I worked in academic research and then transitioned to applied data science in industry.

I've worked with retailers, distributors, and restaurant chains on problems involving pricing, demand, and forecasting. Most of my work is done through agencies, but I also take on direct engagements.

Based in Berlin. I work with clients across Europe and North America.

I speak English, German, Russian, and a little Turkish.
