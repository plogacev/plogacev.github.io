## What is pricing optimization?

Pricing optimization uses data and statistical models to find prices that maximize revenue or profit. Instead of guessing or copying competitors, you let the data guide your decisions.

## Why does it matter?

A 1% improvement in pricing typically has 2-4x the profit impact of a 1% improvement in volume. Yet most companies spend far more effort on sales and marketing than on getting their prices right.

## Common pricing challenges

### "We don't have enough data"
You often have more useful data than you think. Transaction histories, competitor prices, customer segments, and even failed quotes contain pricing signals. Bayesian methods can extract insights from limited data by incorporating business knowledge.

### "Our market is too complex"
Complex markets often mean more pricing opportunity, not less. When you sell thousands of SKUs across different regions, customer segments, or channels, there's usually significant variation in willingness-to-pay that uniform pricing leaves on the table.

### "We tried dynamic pricing and it didn't work"
Most failed pricing initiatives suffer from poor implementation, not bad math. Prices that don't account for inventory, competition, or customer perception will underperform regardless of the underlying model.

## How I approach pricing projects

1. **Understand the business context** - How do sales actually happen? What constraints exist? What does "success" look like?

2. **Assess the data** - What pricing signals exist? What's missing? How clean is it?

3. **Build fit-for-purpose models** - Custom models that match your specific situation, not off-the-shelf solutions forced to fit.

4. **Deliver actionable outputs** - Price recommendations you can actually use, not just elasticity estimates in a spreadsheet.

5. **Measure and iterate** - Track results and refine the approach based on real outcomes.
